Task: 

In `checkout.html` you will find a form with an id of `shipping-address`. Please write the logic to validate the address against the Google Maps API. You can use the following API key: [register for a key with google]. 

The following requirements must be satisfied: 

1. The form should not be submitted until after a validation takes palce.
1. If the validation fails, you are to display an error message to the user. The user should be able to correct any mistakes and resubmit the form. 
1. If the validation fails, the user should have the option to override the failed validation and submit the form with the failed address. You will need to build some kind of simple UI component that allows the user to do this. 


The UI is styled with Bootstrap, so feel free to use that for displaying the error message.

Please do not rely on any external libraries. All work should be done using plain JS.
